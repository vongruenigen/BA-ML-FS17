\chapter*{Preface}
First and foremost, we want to thank our advisers Dr. Mark Cieliebak, Dr. Stephan Neuhaus and Jan Deriu for their ongoing support and guidance throughout the time we were writing this exploratory thesis. The weekly discussions were always a pleasure and helped us a lot to shape our ideas and goals. We also want to express gratitude to our families, colleagues and friends for their patience, support and encouragement to go on, as it was sometimes hard to keep up the motivation, especially in times were everything seemed to go wrong. Last but not least, we also want to thank the Institut f√ºr Angewandte Informationstechnologie from the ZHAW for providing us with the computational resources required to conduct the experiments.
