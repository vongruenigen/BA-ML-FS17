\chapter{Analysis of Results}
We are going to analyze the resulting models after training them as specified in Chapter~\ref{methods:training}.

As the first part, we are going to analyze how the training went and take a look at the results of the metric-based evaluation (see Chapter~\ref{methods:evaluation}). Because we identified some problems with this quantitative analysis, we then show that progress was indeed achieved throughout the training and go into detail why the results of the evaluation are as bad as they are. This includes an analysis into the language model to determine why the models often time respond with generic outputs.

The next part is then dedicated to comparing our models with the results from the paper of Vinyals and Le~\cite{Vinyals:2015} and with the CleverBot chatbot.

The subjects of the last part are analysis related beam-search and the soft-attention mechanism.\todo{Evtl. diesen umschreiben/erg√§nzen}

\section{How Did The Training Go?}
First, let us start by analyzing the evolution of the models with regard to the available performance metrics throughout the time period of the training. Below, in Figures~\ref{results:learning_process:metrics:opensubtitles} and~\ref{results:learning_process:metrics:reddit}, one can see the development of the cross-entropy loss and perplexity values on the training datasets for the two different models.

\paragraph{OpenSubtitles} What is eye-catching when comparing the two is that the OpenSubtitles seems to have much more variance in its performance on the validation set then the Reddit model. This is most probably caused by the fact that the OpenSubtitles dataset is much more noisey than the Reddit, as also noticed by others\cite{Vinyals:2015}. This has to do with the missing information about turn taking, which means it is certainly possible that consecutive utterances in the dataset may be uttered by the same person even though we treat it if it was uttered by two different persons. Also, there is the problematic with the time lags between utterances as analyzed in Chapter~\ref{data:opensubtitles:time_lag_analysis}. In contrast, with the Reddit dataset we always know who uttered a comment and hence can build a dataset which ensures that the dialogs make sense from a structural perspective.

\begin{figure}[H]
	\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{img/plots/opensubtitles_not_reversed/train_metrics.png}
	\caption{Development of the loss and perplexity on the training and validation set throughout the training of the OpenSubtitles model. One tick on the x-axis is equal to $100$ batches processed.}
	\label{results:learning_process:metrics:opensubtitles}
\end{figure}

\paragraph{Reddit} The learning process of the Reddit model looks find, but it also has a peculiarity, namely the dips in the training loss and perplexity. These dips occur about every $300,000$ to $400,000$ batches. They are also present in the development of the validation loss and perplexity, but are not as apparent as in the training metrics. We cannot explain this behaviour currently. We assume that this comes from the fact...\todo{Maybe we should be able?!} The variance however is much smaller than with the OpenSubtitles model, which strengthens our argument, that a well-structured dataset helps a lot when training such systems as it confuses the model much less.\todo{maybe rewrite this sentence somehow}

\begin{figure}[H]
	\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{img/plots/reddit/train_metrics.png}
	\caption{Development of the loss and perplexity on the training and validation set throughout the training of the Reddit model. One tick on the x-axis is equal to $100$ batches processed.}
	\label{results:learning_process:metrics:reddit}
\end{figure} 

\paragraph{The Training Seems Successful} From the looks of the plots, it looks like the training went fine for both models, as both of them have degrading loss and perplexity. We also saw differences in how the models have evolved over the time span of the training, especially the dips in the Reddit model, but we cannot conclude anything from this right now. After we have analyzed the training process, we are now focusing on the performance of the models on the test datasets.

\section{Performance on Test Datasets}
After we have seen that the training process looks fine, we are going to asses the performance of these models on our test datasets. Here we use the same metrics as within the training, namely the cross-entropy loss and perplexity values. We have evaluated each model on the respective test dataset for each checkpoint we have created while training (see Chapter~\ref{methods:training}).

\paragraph{Surprising Results} The results on the test set are quite the opposite of the results from the training process (see Figures~\ref{result:test_performance:opensubtitles} and~\ref{result:test_performance:reddit}), where both of the models are getting worse over time. We did not expect that, but nevertheless, we are going to analyze the problem.\todo{Maybe some more clarification on what analyse means?} The results of the OpenSubtitles model seem to vary across the different checkpoints, with the best result having a perplexity of $71.07$ and a loss of $6.15$ and coming from the evaluation with the first checkpoint.\todo{Values for reddit model in text} The best result of the Reddit model is also achieved on the first checkpoint, with all other checkpoints having a worse perplexity.

This result stands in contradiction to what we have expected. Instead of the loss values going up, we would have expected it to go down in the same way as it did on the training and validation datasets. We assume, that this has to do with the cross-entropy loss and hence the perplexity being not the best fit metrics to evaluate such models, especially in a conversational context where the variety of correct answers can be immensely high. For this reason, we proposed a third performance metric, namely the usage of Sent2Vec~\cite{Pgj:2017} embeddings, to measure the similarity between the expected and generated responses. Before we are going to do this analysis, we want to take a look at different samples from both models to show that they indeed improved over time, even thought the test metrics tell a different story.

\end{figure}

\paragraph{Is Progress Achieved?} As the results of evaluating the models on the test dataset has shown, it seems that the models did not make an meaningful progress throughout the training. Even worse, it looks like the models have become worse over time. For this reason, we decided that we would like to evaluate the model by hand and see if the generated responses improve when using the different six snapshots of the models. We opted for four different input sentences, that means two for each model, and generated responses for each of the snapshots. The results can be seen in the Table~\ref{results:example_output:reddit} for the Reddit model and Table~\ref{results:example_output:opensubtitles} for the OpenSubtitles model.

	\label{results:example_output:opensubtitles}
\end{table}

As seen in the examples above, there has indeed been an improvement in the answers, what stands in contradiction to the development of the performance of the models on the test datasets. Our reasonable suspicion from this is, again, that the cross-entropy loss and perplexity are not fit to asses if the responses are meaningful. As we have already described in Chapter~\ref{fundamentals:sent2vec_test}, we were aware of the fact, that our current set of metrics is not satisfying for evaluating if the responses are meaningful, why we decided to use yet another metric, namely Sent2Vec embeddings, which we are going to use in the next section.

\paragraph{Sent2Vec Analysis} As described in Chapter~\ref{fundamentals:sent2vec_test}, we use Sent2Vec embeddings for measuring the semantic similarity between the generated and expected responses on the test dataset. For this purpose, we have used the pretrained models available on the GitHub page of the project\footnote{https://github.com/epfml/sent2vec}. We have decided, that we use both the \emph{Twitter} and \emph{Wikipedia} models for the assessment. The results can be seen in the Figures~\ref{results:sent2vec:opensubtitles:results} and~\ref{results:sent2vec:reddit:results}. What can be directly seen is that both the Reddit and OpenSubtitles models perform better on the pretrained Wikipedia model in comparison to the pretrained twitter model. This probably has to do with the fact that ``compressed'' language used when writing tweets (e.g. ``w/o'' instead of ``without'') and with the coverage of the vocabulary. In conclusion, the results of this analysis are dependent on the Sent2Vec model, as expected. However, both results are pretty bad, with the Reddit results being much better than the OpenSubtitles, about twice as good (see Tables~\ref{results:sent2vec:opensubtitles:results_table} and~\ref{results:sent2vec:reddit:results_table}). The OpenSubtitles model starts with an average similarity of $0.167$ for the first snapshot and climbs up to $0.204$ for the last snapshot. The Reddit model starts with an average value of $0.336$ for the first snapshot and increases to $0.359$ for the last snapshot. This means, that the responses of the Reddit model match the expected responses much better from a semantic perspective as the responses of the OpenSubtitles model do. In summary, the results of both models are highly pretty bad, as the maximum similarity is $1.0$.

\paragraph{Generic Response are a Problem} One potential reason for the bad results when using the Sent2Vec metric is that we witnessed both models generating generic responses a lot of the time. To analyze this our first idea was to see, what kind of sentences the models produce with the inputs of the test datasets. We did an analysis on the generated responses and quickly noticed that there are a few sentences, which the models predict a lot of time (see Tables~\ref{results:test_performance:opensubtitles_sample_outputs} and~\ref{results:test_performance:reddit_sample_outputs}).\todo{name percentages of tables}

\paragraph{Does Filtering of Generic Responses Help?} As seen in the both tables above, there are certain responses which are generated a lot of time and are pretty generic and meaningless. Because of that, we thought it would be a good idea to evaluate the models under the Sent2Vec metric one more time, but this time with the top $n$ generic sentences filtered out. We did this with the hope that the generic sentences are the cause of the small average similarities. The results of the analysis with the top $n$ sentences filtered out can be found in Table~\ref{results:sent2vec:opensubtitles:top_n_results_table} and~\ref{results:sent2vec:reddit:top_n_results_table}. For this analysis, we have only used the Wikipedia model as it has shown a better performance for both of our models before.

	\label{results:sent2vec:reddit:top_n_results_table}
\end{table}

As seen in the tables above, the filtering of the most used responses does not help a lot when it comes to the Sent2Vec evaluation. We currently cannot say if this problem is just apparent in our use-case or if it this problem is inherent to the metric itself. To get a definitive conclusion, we would have to investigate into using this metric also for other models. \todo{Maybe one more sentence? Maybe say that metric should be applied to ther models (e.g. Google Paper) to see if we are really that bad or if it is inheritent to the metrics itself}

\paragraph{Mixed Feelings about Performance Metrics} As seen in this chapter, the performance metrics used to evaluate the models tell us a mixed story about the resulting models. On one hand, we see that the training went fine and the learning process run as expected. However, when we then test these trained models against the test datasets with the different metrics, it looks like the performance got worse and worse over the time of the training. This is not true in our subjective opinion after ``talking'' to both models for a prolonged period of time. We think the biggest problem for the evaluation are the generic responses both models seem to generate much more than actual answers. To find the cause of this generic responses, we will now try to analyze the language model which both models have learned while training and try to establish a connection between the language model in the datasets and the ones produced by the models.

\section{Development of Language Model}
\label{results:development_language_model}
As said at the end of the previous chapter, in this chapter we are going to investigate into the language models the trained models produce and try to find a substantiation for our claim, that the models generate generic responses much more than.

\subsection{Uni- and Bi-gram Distributions over Time}
As the first step, we are going to compare the uni- and bigram distributions of the training datasets with the distributions produced when evaluating the models with the test datasets. For this purpose we generated unigram and bigram statistics using \texttt{nltk} over the training datasets and outputs generated by the models.

\paragraph{OpenSubtitles} The OpenSubtitles has the most evenly spread distributions when using the first snapshot (i.e. 0.5M). We see a pattern when we look at all distributions of the OpenSubtitles model. In the beginning, it starts with a pretty evenly spread distribution of uni- and bi-grams. As the training goes on, this distributions shift to a more right-leaned when looking at the distributions for the snapshot 1.0M. The distributions then switch back to be more evelny distributed again. This pattern repeats until the end, with one snapshot being evenly distributed whereas the next is then more right-leaned again.

We cannot give a full explanation for this behaviour, but we assume that this has to do with the rather noisey dataset we are using for the OpenSubtitles model. This probably leads to the model being confused, rejecting what it has already learned and trying to fit to the new samples seen. Because of the fact that we cannot explain this behaviour, we are going to analyze the development of the diversity of the uni-/bi-gram and sentences over the course of the training.

The behaviour is the same for the uni-gram distributions, which is the reason we put these visualizations in the Appendix~\ref{APPENDIX UNIGRAM OPUS}.

\end{figure}

\paragraph{Reddit} The distributions for the Reddit model reveal an interesting development (see Figure~\ref{results:bigram:distributions:reddit}). In the beginning, same as with the OpenSubtitles, the distributions are evenly spread. However, as the training goes on, the distributions start to better fit the expected distributions more and more, until it reaches the greatest overlap when using the snapshot 2.0M. From this point on, the distributions start to diverge again. This coincides with our opinion, that the Reddit model is best when using the snapshot 2.0M. This probably has to do with the fact that we are doing more than two epochs over the full dataset. From the snapshot 2.0M on, the model itself starts to become worse, as the diversity and quality of the responses starts to decline. We are going to analyze that assumption below.

The behavior is the same for the uni-gram distributions, which is the reason we put these visualizations in the Appendix~\ref{APPENDIX UNIGRAM REDDIT}.

\subsection{Language Diversity}
As said in the last Chapter, we are now going to analyze the language diversity of the outputs the two models produce over the different snapshots. For this purpose, we are analyzing the how large the share of the top 10 uni-, bi-gram and sentences is within the generated responses. The results can be seen in the Table~\ref{results:top_10_frequency:reddit} for Reddit and \ref{results:top_10_frequency:OpenSubtitle} for OpenSubtitle. \todo{Zwischen den beiden Corpora gibt es eine besindere Auff√§lligkeit, die Anzahl benutzter W√∂rter ist beim reddit viel h√∂her. (wtf *3?? han zahle kontrolliert, aber isch strange).}

\todo{wir k√∂nnten schreiben, dass die absoluten Zahlen keine Tendenz anzeigen (das sehen wir schon in der Tabelle), die Werte nehmen absolut gesehen nicht ab, es ist f√ºr uns kein Muster erkennbar. Deshalb haben wir Tabelle mit dem prozentualen Anteil erg√§nzt. Die Werte sind nun nicht mehr ganz so chaotisch, dies h√§ngt damit zusammen, dass eben auch die Anzahl verwendeter uni-gramme und bi-gramme pro Snapshot sich ver√§ndert. Dies ist ein Indiz daf√ºr, dass die S√§tze l√§nger werden und somit semantisch anspruchsvoller?!

Um diese Enwicklung pro Modell besser zu sehen und auch die Korrelation innerhalb eines Modells zwischen uni-gramm/bi-Gramm und sentence, haben wir die prozentuale Werte geplotet?!}
\todo{weiss nicht wohin damit, aber wollen wir noch erkl√§ren, was es bedeuted, wenn die Kurce sinkt? also interpretiert z.B.:Die Werte sind so zu interpretieren, dass wenn die Werte sinken bedeutet dies, dass der Anteil der Top 10 S√§tze/uni-gramm/bi-gram an der Gesamtmenge sinkt, was wir als positive Entwicklung werten, weil vielf√§ltiger? W√ºrde nur die Satzkurve sinken, nicht aber die Bi-Gramm Kurve, dann w√ºrde es eben auf Stufe bi-gramm nicht vielf√§ltiger werden. Da wir aber auf allen 3 Stufen diese Tendenz sehen, wird es auf allen 3 Stufen vielf√§ltiger?}

\end{table}

\todo{Absatz k√∂nnte man dan streichen }
We cannot see a tendency when visualizing the absolute occurrence frequencies of the top 10 uni-, bi-gram and sentences (see Figure~\ref{FIGURE_ABSOLUTE}). For this reason, we started to do the same analysis, but this time with relative values instead of absolute (see Figure~\ref{FIGURE_PERC}). Here we can see the same pattern emerging again as in the last chapter.

\paragraph{OpenSubtitles} The plot for the OpenSubtitles (see Figure~\ref{results:language_model:diversity:opensubtitles}) shows the same patterns as with the distributions seen before. Throughout the course of the training, it looks like that the diversity of the language model wobbles up and down. Our assumption for this flattering development is the same as with the distributions, we think that the noisey training datasets might be responsible for that. But, if we take a close look at the numbers, we see that the peaks are getting smaller and smaller. For example, the share of the top 10 sentences and words for the 2.0M model is about $2\%$ to $3\%$ lower than with the 1.0M model. The difference, when looking at the numbers for the bi-grams is much smaller, only about $0.02\%$. Nevertheless, in total, we can see a tendency that the model starts to use a more diverse language model as longer as the training goes.

	\caption{Development how much percentage of all uni-, bi-grams and sentences are covered by the top 10 most used of each category.}
	\label{results:language_model:diversity:opensubtitles}
\end{figure}\todo{Caption!}

\paragraph{Reddit} The plot for the Reddit model (see Figure~\ref{results:language_model:diversity:reddit}) reveals, that the language model gets more diverse throughout the course of the training until the minimum is reached when using the 2.0M model. From this point on, it starts to become less and less diverse for the rest of the training. This coincides with our opinion, that the model is best when using the 2.0M snapshot. Our assumption for this behaviour is, that we are running into problems due to the fact, that between the snapshots 1.5M and 2.0M we are starting the second epoch over the training dataset. This could lead to some kind of overfitting effect, which worsens the results and diversity of the language used by the model.

\subsection{Results}
Our analysis has shown, that the models do indeed produce a large amount of generic sentences, but this problem weakens over the time of the training, especially for the OpenSubtitles model. The second problem we could identify is, that iterating over the same dataset multiple times, does not seem to be advisable. Using a regularization technique, such as Dropout, would probably help in the case of a small dataset.

%Wir m√∂chten herausfinden, ob mit Fortlaufendem Training die Sprachvielfalt der responses zunimmt. F√ºr diese Auswertung ber√ºcksichtigen wir die top 10 Uni-Gramm, Bi-Gramme und S√§tze pro Snapshot und Modell (siehe Anhang \ref{}) und z√§hlen deren H√§ufigkeit. Die Resultate k√∂nnen Sie aus der Tabelle \ref{} entnehmen, wir haben die Tabelle noch mit der maximalen Anzahl Uni-Gramme, Bi-Gramme und S√§tze pro Snapshot erg√§nzt. Anhand er absoluten Zahlen kann man keine Tendenz angeben, deshalb haben wir den Prozentualen Anteil der Top 10 Artefakte an der Gesamtmenge pro Snapshot berechnet. Diese Werte befinden sich in den Spalten Prozentual.
%Um die Entwicklung zwischen den Snapshot besser zu erkennen, erstellten wir mit den relativen Werten ein Diagramm pro Corpus. Die Kurve ist so zu interpretieren, dass wenn die Werte sinken bedeutet dies, dass der Anteil der Top 10 Artefakte an der Gesamtmenge sinkt. Wir sehen dabei deutliche Unterschiede pro Corpus.
%\paragraph{OpenSubtitles}Die OpenSubtitle Kurve \ref{} zeigt insgesamt eine leichte Verbesserung jedoch mit lokalen Verschlechterungen. Die Spitze beim Snapshot 2.0M ist bei den S√§tzen und W√∂rtern um 2-3 \% tiefer, als diejenige bei 1.0M. Bei den Bi-Grams ist der Unterschied eher klein mit 0.02 \%. Die Ursache f√ºr diese Zackenkurve(?) vermuten wir in den Daten. Diese sind wie bereits erw√§htn noisy. In der Tendenz sehen wir jedoch ein Gef√§lle.

\section{Comparison with Other Models}
As the next part, we want to compare the results of our model with two others we use as a reference: The CleverBot\footnote{http://www.cleverbot.com/} chatbot and the results from the paper ``Neural Conversational Model''~\cite{Vinyals:2015}, whose model architecture serves as the base of our model.\todo{name differences?} We test the quality of the responses from our models when confronted with utterances of different type and difficulty. We do this in the hope that we can reveal where the strengths and weaknesses of our models lie.

\subsection{Cleverbot}
\label{results:comparison:cleverbot}
We start with the comparison with the CleverBot. Keep in mind, that the CleverBot is a non-deterministic chatbot which means that the responses might be different if it is fed with the same inputs but a different point in time. The responses listed below were generated at the first of June between 12am and 15am.

\paragraph{Simple Utterance} We start by using the two simple utterances ``How are you?'' and ``Hi there, i m john!''. As one can see in the Tables~\ref{results:example1_output:OpenSubtitle_compared} and~\ref{results:example1_output:Reddit_compared}, both our OpenSubtitles model and the CleverBot answered this question with satisfying responses. The responses of the Reddit model to the utterance ``Hi there, i m john!'' are pretty bad as none of them is really useful. The response of the CleverBot to this utterance makes more sense in this case.
\\

	\label{results:example1_output:Reddit_compared}
\end{table}

\paragraph{Closed Question} As next, we are trying to see which responses are produced when using a closed question as the utterance. The results can be seen in the Tables~\ref{results:example2_output:OpenSubtitle_compared} and~\ref{results:example2_output:Reddit_compared}. With this type of utterance, we would like to evaluate if the models understand a closed question and can respond appropriately.

From the looks it seems that our models can respond to closed questions appropriately, as both of them gave appropriate answers. The CleverBot has problems with this question, probably because it does not understand how the concepts of flying and birds are related.

		\end{tabular}
	\end{adjustbox}
	\caption{Responses to a closed question from the Reddit models and the CleverBot response.}
	\label{results:example2_output:Reddit_compared}
\end{table}

\paragraph{Knowledge Question}
The next kind of utterance are knowledge questions. With this kind of questions we would like to evaluate if the models have knowledge about the world. The results can be seen in the Tables~\ref{results:example3_output:OpenSubtitle_compared} and~\ref{results:example3_output:Reddit_compared}.

The responses to the question about the color of the sky have an interesting development. Until the snapshot 2.0M, the responses were not appropriate and did not have any meaningful content\footnote{The response ``the jews'' comes from the fact, that in the beginning of the OpenSubtitles dataset, there are a lot of conversations related to movies about Nazism.}. However, from the snapshot 2.0M on the model answered in a correct way, even though it one time replied with red as the answer, which is obviously wrong. But it also had it right two times, whereas the last response from the 3.0M seems to be the best. The answer of the CleverBot to this question is quite meaningless and has absolutely nothing to do with the provided question.

The response to the question where the Reddit model lives was answered in a satisfying way, maybe except for the response of the 2.0M snapshot. It clearly understands the context of the question, as it always answers with a location-related answer. The CleverBot answers this question completely correct.

\begin{table}[H]

	\begin{adjustbox}{max width=\textwidth}

		\end{tabular}

		\end{tabular}
	\end{adjustbox}
	\caption{Responses to a knowledge question from the Reddit models and the CleverBot response.}
	\label{results:example3_output:Reddit_compared}
\end{table}

\paragraph{Contextual Question} 
With the next question, we want to try to evaluate if the models are capable of using contextual informations to build an appropriate response. The results can be seen in the Tables~\ref{results:example4_output:OpenSubtitle_compared} and~\ref{results:example4_output:Reddit_compared}.

As visible below, the OpenSubtitles models has big problems with this kind of utterances, as all the responses are not fitting. The only response that is close to being useful is the one of the 2.5M model, where it at least includes the right color in the response. The response of the CleverBot is in this case also not of relevance.

The responses of the Reddit model are more fitting to the question, but they are also pretty bad in comparison to what we have expected. At least it tries to formulate responses where the two colors of the question are comprised. The answer of the CleverBot is again useless, this time even more in comparison with the response given when using the question from the OpenSubtitles model.

\paragraph{Specific Question}
The next questions are more specific, we are going to ask the OpenSubtitles model a simple mathematical question and the Reddit models a question about the TV series ``Game of Thrones''. The results can be seen in the Tables~\ref{results:example5_output:OpenSubtitle_compared} and~\ref{results:example5_output:Reddit_compared}.

The responses of the OpenSubtitles in the beginning are quite clear, it does not know the answer or does not understand the question at all. However, the later snapshots (i.e. from 2.0M on), it seems to understand that it has to answer with a number. Sadly, the correct results is not in the generated responses. The CleverBot also does not understand how to answer such a question.

The Reddit model has an interesting twist in its responses. In the beginning, it starts by responding with generic responses which do not seem to have anything to do with the series itself. However, the funny response\footnote{``Hodor'' is a character in the ``Game of Thrones'' series who is only capable of saying its own name. In case of danger he starts yelling its name over and over several time throughout the series.} at the end indicates that it understands the question at least to some degree, even though the response does not contain any actual information about the series. The CleverBot response is a mysterious to us, as we cannot remember any scene from the series where a ``Dani'' plays a major role.

\paragraph{Answers to Statements}
Until now, we have only asked questions to our models. We would now like to see how the responses are if we input a statement instead of a question. The results can be seen in the Tables~\ref{results:example6_output:OpenSubtitle_compared} and~\ref{results:example6_output:Reddit_compared}.

The responses of the OpenSubtitles model are useful from the snapshot 2.0M and forward. Especially the answer for the snapshot 2.0M is interesting, as this seems to indicate that the model has some kind of empathy for the other person in the dialog, as it say ``i m sorry''. The response of the CleverBot signifies that it understands the statement to some degree, but does not know what to answer.

The responses of the Reddit model to the statement that it has a bad opinion are pretty bad across the board, with the response from the 1.5M model being the only one which is useful. The response of the CleverBot is a pretty speedy answer in this case.

\paragraph{Self-Concept} At the end, we have an interesting answer from the Reddit model to the question ``What are you?''. The responses can be seen in Table~\ref{results:example7_output:Reddit_compared}. All snapshots produce bad responses, apart from the last, which answered that it is a bot. This is an interesting answer because it shows that the model seems to have some kind of self-concept. We cannot explain that, as the model was trained on comments from Reddit discussion about movies and series. Nevertheless, it is an interesting answer to see.

Sadly, we were not able to find a similar response when using the OpenSubtitles model.

\subsection{Neural Conversational Model}
\label{results:comparison:ncm}
In this section, we are going to compare the results from the paper ``Neural Conversation Model'' (NCM) with the results from our models. To compare the responses, we are going to use utterances from the paper and show all the responses from all OpenSubtitles snapshots, but only the (subjectively) best response from the Reddit model, as the NCM model was trained on the OpenSubtitles dataset. The responses can be seen in the Tables~\ref{results:example8_output:Neural_Conversational_Model_compared} to~\ref{results:example14_output:Neural_Conversational_Model_compared}. The categories where the input utterances came from in the paper are noted in the table descriptions.

We are only showing a part of the dialogs which were evaluated. All others can be found in Appendix~\ref{apendix:results:compared_with_NCM}.

\subsection{Results}
In conclusion, our model is not as bad as it seemed when looking at the problems with the metrics and the generic responses coming from an undiversified language model.

In comparison to the CleverBot, our model had several responses which were clearly superior to its. But there were also cases where the CleverBot was better. This has probably to do with the fact that the CleverBot works by fuzzily searching already existing conversations. This means, that if a conversation about a certain topic does not exist, the CleverBot has no possibility to meaningful answer. Our model instead has the ability to ``understand'' what is said and hence can at least try to answer. Such an example would be the mathematical question ``How much is 1 added to 2?'', where the CleverBot simply answered ``I don't know'', whereas our model started to respond with numbers, even though the result was not correct.

When comparing our models to the NCM model, it quickly becomes clear what the main problem is: The size of the model. For easy to understand utterances, the responses of our models are almost or as good as the responses from the NCM model. But if the utterances get more complicated, especially when it comes to philosophical or morality questions, our model starts to become worse than the NCM model. This is, as said, not a real surprise, because our model is only half the size of the NCM model. Nevertheless, we conclude that our model is not superior, but in some regards of equal quality as the NCM model.

\section{Beam-Search}
\label{results:beam_search}
There are always some bad replies in the examples seen above. To fix this, we would like to use a simple beam-search implementation as described in Chapter~\ref{fundamentals:decoding_approaches} to see if that helps to fix this problem. We will evaluate this for three different examples, and judge in a subjective if the responses generated by the beam-search decoder are superior to the responses of the greedy decoder. This analysis is only done with the OpenSubtitle 3.0M model and a beam-width of $200$.

We only list the subjectively best responses here. All other responses can be found in Appendix~\ref{apendix:results:Beam-search-200:OpenSubtitle}.

\paragraph{``what year were you born?''} The responses of the greedy decoder to this question can be found in the Table~\ref{results:example8_output:Neural_Conversational_Model_compared}. The original answers of the OpenSubtitles model were all pretty bad, and it seemed that it did not fully understand the question.

However, when using the beam-search decoder, there are several useful responses, such as ``1991'', ``last year'' or ``five years ago''. This responses are much better than what the greedy decoder initially produced. However, they are not the highest ranked response and hence are not returned by the model if we only take a look at the best response.

\paragraph{``i wear a blue jeans. what color do my jeans have?''} The second question was also answered pretty poorly. The results of the greedy decoder can be found in Table~\ref{results:example4_output:OpenSubtitle_compared}. The best response came from the 2.5M model ans was ``i got a blue blue'', which, at least, contains the searched color.

When using beam-search, better responses can be found and include ``blue'' and ``you know that''.

\paragraph{``what is the purpose of being intelligent?''} As the last one, we wanted to try a complicated question from the moral section of the NCM paper with beam-search. The responses of the greedy decoder can be found in Table~\ref{results:example4_output:OpenSubtitle_compared} and are bad overall and only consist of generic responses, such as ``i don t know''.

When using beam-search, several interesting responses were produced fitting for such a philosophical question. The fitting answers are ``well, it s complicated'', ``you can t know'' and ``well , it s nothing.''

\paragraph{Beam-Search Helps} The responses got much more diverse when using the beam-search decoder. The problem is to choose which of the 200 generated responses are the best. Usually, the sum of the logarithmic probabilities at each step in the beam is used. However, this does not lead to the answers we selected as ``best'' from above. We are not completely sure if this is due to a problem in the implementation or the beam-search or if it is simply not working as expected because the model was trained with a greedy decoder, which might not be able to simply adapt to using a beam-search decoder. Nevertheless, the implementation gave us a lot of insight into the inner workings of the model and we were able to find better responses than with the greedy decoder, even thought we had to select them by hand.

\section{Thought Vectors for Input Sequences} After the encoder has processed the whole input sequences, it pass the thought vector forward to the decoder to construct the output sequence (see Chapter~\ref{fundamentals:seq2seq}). It is the only direct connection the encoder and decoder have in such a model, which means, that the encoder has to ``encode'' all the information into this thought vector before passing it to the decoder. The thought vector hence represents an embedding of the input sequence in an $n$ dimensional vector space, where $n$ stands for the size of the thought vector. If we project them down to two dimension via PCA, sentences with similar meanings should be clustered together. That would show that the models have a semantic understanding of the contents of these sentences.

To analyze the embeddings, we collected them for 15 different sample sentences and created thought vectors for them. We did this with both models and projected the vectors via PCA into two dimensional space, the results of this projection can be see in Figure~\ref{results:thougth_vectors:embeddings:opensubtitles} and~\ref{results:thougth_vectors:embeddings:reddit} below.

\begin{figure}[!tb]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=14cm]{img/opensubtitles_thought_vector_embeddings.png}
	\caption{The projected thought vectors for 15 different sentences when using the OpenSubtitles 3.0M model. PCA was used for the projection.}
	\label{results:thougth_vectors:embeddings:opensubtitles}
\end{figure}

\begin{figure}[H]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=14cm]{img/reddit_thought_vector_embeddings.png}
	\caption{The projected thought vectors for 15 different sentences when using the Reddit 2.0M model. PCA was used for the projection.}
	\label{results:thougth_vectors:embeddings:reddit}
\end{figure}

Both of the models seem to have no problems understanding clear, direct sentences where the intent is clear (e.g. ``I have no interest in your opinion on movies, your taste is bad!''). This can be seen because similar sentences are clustered together in the projected space. However, when it comes to curses and questions regarding the gender, the OpenSubtitles model starts to struggle, which can be seen by taking a look at the respective points in the projected space. The questions regarding the gender or the curses are scattered throughout the space, even though they should have been embedded closely to each other. The Reddit model seems to have less problems with this, as the embeddings for these sentences are much closer together. But what is interesting to see is that the Reddit model embeds the sentences with curses close to the sentences regarding the gender.

In general, it looks like our models have an understanding of these different sentences as most of them are clustered together if they contain similar content.

\section{Soft-Attention}
\label{results:soft_attention}
As the last part, we want to take a look at the soft-attention mechanism (see Chapter~\ref{fundamentals:soft_attention}) and analyze if the model benefits from it by looking at the resulting attention weights. We assume it does not help a lot, as Vinyals and Le already notice in their paper~\cite{Vinyals:2015}. The visualizations are generated by feeding an utterance to our models and then visualizing the resulting attention weights (see Chapter~\ref{fundamentals:soft_attention}) in a heat-map over the different time steps of the decoder. As utterances we use three different examples, one general question, on mathematical question and a an example which consists of two sentences with a relative pronoun in the second sentence, which refers to the subject of the first sentence.

We do this analysis with both the OpenSubtitles 3.0M and the Reddit 2.0M models.

\paragraph{Attention Visualizations} The visualizations of the attention weights can be seen in Figures~\ref{results:attention:example3:opensubtitles-3M} and~\ref{results:attention:example3:reddit}. There are more visualizations of the same kind in Appendix~\ref{appendix:soft_attention}.

As one can see, the generated attention weights do not show a significant alignment with important words from the input utterance. For example when looking at the input utterance ``anna is 18 years old. how old is she?'' (Figure~\ref{results:attention:example3:reddit}), one would expect that the decoder would place a large attention weight on the thought vector when the actual age of the person was processed. However, this is not the case.

\begin{figure}[H]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=10cm]{img/attention/attention_visualization3_reddit_2m.png}
	\caption{Visualization of the attention weights when using the utterance ``anna is 18 years old. how old is she?". On the x-axis, the input utterance is placed at the top. On the y-axis, the response from the model is placed. Each square in the heatmap corresponds to the attention weight the decoder computed for the thought vector of the corresponding word (x-axis) when producing the corresponding response word (y-axis). The Reddit 2.0M was used here.}
	\label{results:attention:example3:reddit}
\end{figure}

The second example, where attention does not seem to work or help, can be found in Figures~\ref{results:attention:example3:opensubtitles-3M}. Here it is the same problem as before, the attention weights do not align with the important thought vectors from the input utterance.

Each square in the heatmap corresponds to the attention weight the decoder computed for the thought vector of the corresponding word (x-axis) when producing the corresponding response word (y-axis). The OpenSubtitles 3.0M was used here.}

From this quick analysis, we can reaffirm that the soft-attention mechanism does indeed not help a lot when it comes to conversational models, as Vinyals and Le also noticed.
